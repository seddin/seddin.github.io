As Wikipedia states, Lazarus is a free cross-platform visual integrated development environment for rapid application development using the Free Pascal compiler. This is an awesome and lighweight way to make simple yet very usefull graphical apps. It took me about 12 hours to have the first version of this little tool working üí™ ü§ò.As of now I‚Äôve only released the Windows binary. You can use this tool to download videos from youtube by typing an URL in the input field and after choosing a file format the video will start downloading, instead of typing commands. 1$ youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdvoU-VGsWU -f 140 The first time it will take a couple of extra seconds more that usual, because it‚Äôll be extracting the youtube-dl file into your AppData directory. This app was made with ‚ù§ by seddin, I hope you enjoy it!
